where is new Data stored
should data storing be done at all ?
yes

maybe figure out interactions before just coding





for each Name
there is a Unique Location for every Program





UniformElement
	knows GenericShaders it is in
GenericShader
	knows UniformElements in it

Update from Value Change
	go through all ProgramLocations
	if any Program Is
		PutData(location)
		put Data in Program
	else
		StoreData()
		set NeedsUpdate

Update From Shader Activation
	go through all Uniforms
	if any NeedsUpdate Is
		PutData(Location)
		put Data in Program

Data is stored in Child of UniformElement
