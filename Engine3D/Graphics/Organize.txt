Graphics
{
	Base
	{
		Base_Data ?
		Base_Buffer
			a Buffer that takes InstanceDataType for Binding
		Base_BufferData
			a Base_Buffer with EntryContainerDynamic of InstanceDataType
			could be combined with Base_Buffer ?
		Base_Array
			an Array of Base_BufferData
			should change name

		these should be usable for things like AxisBox as well ?
		this is the Wire Shader stuff that I was writing somewhere else
		having a completely seperate Base_Array for all PolyHedra might be wastefull (Memory) ?
		but I can use Element Buffers here so that would save some Memory
