generic shader vs specific shader



generic Shader:
	shader has a list for uniforms
	after shader is made it can be told to look for a uniform
	if that uniform is found in the shader, the data is set to a specified data

	++++
		no wrapper needed
	----
		uniforms need to be specified outside of the shader



specific Shader:
	the shader knows what uniforms it needs

	++++
		uniforms are in 
	----
		needs a wrapper





problem with specific

it has the uniforms built in
but the vert/geom/frag shaders can have somewhat independant uniforms

make segmetns for each shader Type
