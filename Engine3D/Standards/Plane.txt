Voxels
	replace Flat Plane with a Voxel Plane
	voxels should be smaller then in MineCraft in order to provide a differant experiance
	and for better detail ?

	make it 2 Sided (height 0 is the middle)
	have a Chunk Index Limit of short.Max or something
	so that the whole thing can be explored in a reasonable amout of time
	
	calculare Position relative to the Chunk
		to prevent float rounding errors

	make non-Cube Voxels
	Concrete:	perfect Cube
	Stone:		slight imperfections (random offset of corners)
	Gravel:		form Piles ?
		if it has no "Powder" Neighbours and no Solid Neightbours
			bottom should spead out a little
			top should go into a 
		if Solid Neightbours
			only spead bottom to edge
		if Powder Neightours
			connect with that
