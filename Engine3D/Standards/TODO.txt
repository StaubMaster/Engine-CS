put on GitHub
	to revert when something dosent work anymore
	or put on GitHub after sorting things ?



categorize stuff
especially in Abstract
	split PolyHedra into
		Abstract PolyHedra (Skeleton)
		PolyHedra Skin
			Simple / Texture
		Transformed PolyHedra
	File Context
		for anything that comes from a file
		for debugging
		also make debugging better

put new Graphic stuff into old stuff
	only the surface2D stuff dosent have it currently
	it's a lot
	but also I feel kind of sentimental about deleting it

also kind of the reason why the old file parsing stuff still exists
	should probably just convert everything to the new stanard
	but thats also kind of a lot
	its not like I'm gonna make things with the old standards anymore



stuff to (re)add in the future
	spline curves (interpolation)
