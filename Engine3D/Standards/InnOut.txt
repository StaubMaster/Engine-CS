splitting thins into InnPut and OutPut was a nice idea at first
but dosent really work

right now the only thing in InnPut that is being used is TMovement

and the stuff in OutPut is basically just the old Graphics Folder

so, remove old Graphics Folder and rename OutPut

put YMT_Display in there too and rename it back to Window

put UI stuff from VoidFactory in there too,
but maybe organize first
