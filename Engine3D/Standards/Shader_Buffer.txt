right now both are unorganized and need a lot of extra where they are used

make static classes for each "type" ?
	Body.Shader.
	Body.Shader.Default()
	Body.Buffer.

different Uniforms
	update sometimes
	update once per frame
	update multiple times per frame

	sometimes and once per frame can be combined

	multiple times per frame shouldnt be done at all ?
	use instances instead
		Trans of Bodys

new Uniforms
	do uniforms need to store anything
	the only have setters anyway
	but with something kile depth
		if far changes, then the new values need near to calculate
		but aparently you can get that data out of the shader
		so you can just read it
		that can only be done if the program is bound
		but rebinding program is inefficient so dont do that anyway

	is a Class needed ?
		since no data is saved, could I just make it static ?
		uniform location needs to be saved , so store that ?




Frame()
	ShaderProgram.Use()
	update once per frame Uniforms
		update once per Body uniforms
		draw
