YMT_Dispaly
	option 1.
		rename to Display
		turn into Wrapper for GL_Control and GameWindow
	option 2.
		rename to Window
		make new Wrapper for GL_Control ?
		they should be similar
		make a wrapper and inherit both from there ?



GLSL
	the shader Files should be cleaned up anyway
	put them in /YMT/ ?
		that is more for 3D Models
		and other YMT related stuff
		GLSL is not YMT
	put them in /VoidFactory/Config/ ?
		thats where they are used
		so it kinda makes sense



Buffer
	make a Wrapper for ShaderPrograms
		they know what their Buffers should look like
		they know exactly what unifroms they want to have
			if a uniform isnt found, give an error
		should they know what files they uses
