how to parse command ?

needs to start with "var"

then a variable "name"
	can contain AlphaNumeric and '_'
	cannot start with a digit
	cannot only be a _

then a "="
	this makes sense but not sure if it is needed
	since it dosent do anything ?

then needs a valid "type"
	float, point, angle, index

then the "value"
	in the case of the examples, it is a point
	which has 3 values
	which are seperated by ":"
	are the () needed ?
		yes. some others might take a point and an angle
		and having 2 pairs of 3 would be easier to understand then 6 values



#	type in variable ?
var name point(0:1:2);





how to parse math ?

it is known what type is expected ?

var name float(1) + float(2);

explicitly stating float seems annoying ?

var name 1 + 2;


var name0 point(1:2:3);
var name1 name0 + point(1:2:3);
var name2 point(name0.x:0:2);







Index Management ?
should be seperate from floating point stuff ?

[0]
1 Index of Value 0

[0 : 1]
2 Index of Value 1 and 2

[0 ~ 2]
Values going from 0 to 2
so same as
[0 : 1 : 2]



[0 : 2] : [1 : 3]
2 sets of Indexes
set 1 is 0 and 2
set 2 is 1 and 3
