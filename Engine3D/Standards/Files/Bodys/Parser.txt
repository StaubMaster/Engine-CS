the old Parser is kind of ugly but it works

create a new parser that is not backwards compatible
if the new one dosent work for a file: try the old one

how should the new one work


file starts with "YMT?" followed by '\n'

then Headers
[Manual] or [Automatic]

this tells the Parser what parsers to use
[Automatic] is simpler and faster
[Manual] is more complex and gives more control



[Automatic]
only v (vertex) and t (triangle)



Lines in [Manual]

vertex: 02 : 23 + 2 : 23;	#example

Lines start with an Indicator and end with ';'
Comments go from '#' to the next '\n'



math: asd = 12 + 34;	# math old
asd = 12 + 34;			# math new
if the line contains '=' then its a math assign
no need for indicating math
variables can only contain [0..9] [A..Z] [a..z] [_]
if only [0..9] then its a literal number (allow starting with digits ?)
allow 0x for hexadecimal ?



belt00 id the old systems
new should be
belt(-+<>): 0 : 2 : 3 : 4;
belt(): 0 : 2 : 3 : 4;
- is open
+ is closed
> is foreward
< is backward
empty is default
multiple will use last
basically start with default values, then go over list and change to whatever is seen
if unexpected, ignore ? throw error ?
have strict mode and lenient mode



change Axis ?

change Index
i want to split these into Abstract and Skin files
so Index in Abstract only needs to change the vertex index
